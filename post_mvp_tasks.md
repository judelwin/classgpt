# üöÄ ClassGPT Post-MVP Production Scaling Plan

This document outlines a **practical, incremental approach** to transform the current MVP into a production-ready system. We'll make small, testable changes that don't break the existing functionality.

---

## üéØ The Realistic Approach

### Current State (What Works)
- ‚úÖ Document upload and processing
- ‚úÖ Class management
- ‚úÖ RAG queries with citations
- ‚úÖ Docker setup for local development

### What We Actually Need for Production
1. **User accounts** (so people can sign up and use it)
2. **Cloud storage** (so files don't live on your server)
3. **Production deployment** (so it's not just local)
4. **Basic security** (so it's not wide open)

---

## üìã Phase 1: Add User Accounts (Incremental)

### Step 1.1: Add Users Table (Backward Compatible)
**File: `database/init.sql`**
```sql
-- Add users table (doesn't break existing data)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add user_id to classes (nullable, so existing classes still work)
ALTER TABLE classes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id);
```

### Step 1.2: Create Simple Auth Service
**New folder: `auth-service/`**
```python
# auth-service/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import bcrypt
import jwt

app = FastAPI()

class UserLogin(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: str

@app.post("/login")
def login(user: UserLogin):
    # Simple login logic
    pass

@app.post("/register") 
def register(user: UserLogin):
    # Simple registration
    pass
```

### Step 1.3: Update Frontend (Optional Step)
- Add login/register pages
- Keep existing functionality working
- Users can still use the app without logging in initially

**Why this works:** Existing data and functionality stays intact. Users table is separate, classes can work with or without users.

---

## üìã Phase 2: Cloud Storage (Simple Migration)

### Step 2.1: Add S3 Support (Parallel to Local)
**File: `shared/storage.py`**
```python
import boto3
import os

def upload_file(file_data, filename):
    # Try S3 first, fall back to local
    if os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY"):
        return upload_to_s3(file_data, filename)
    else:
        return save_locally(file_data, filename)
```

### Step 2.2: Update Upload Service (Backward Compatible)
**File: `ingestion-service/main.py`**
```python
# Keep existing local upload logic
# Add S3 upload as an option
if os.getenv("USE_S3"):
    # Use S3
    file_url = upload_to_s3(file_data, filename)
else:
    # Use local (existing behavior)
    file_path = save_locally(file_data, filename)
```

**Why this works:** Existing uploads keep working. S3 is optional and can be enabled gradually.

---

## üìã Phase 3: Production Deployment (Simple)

### Step 3.1: Environment-Based Configuration
**File: `docker-compose.prod.yml`**
```yaml
# Copy existing docker-compose.yml
# Add production environment variables
# Use production database (RDS) instead of local
# Use S3 instead of local storage
```

### Step 3.2: Simple Deployment Script
**File: `deploy.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Build and push Docker images
# Deploy to a cloud provider (Railway, Render, etc.)
# Set environment variables
```

## üîÑ Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: User Accounts
1. **Day 1-2**: Add users table, create auth service
2. **Day 3-4**: Test that existing functionality still works
3. **Day 5**: Add basic login/register to frontend

### Week 2: Cloud Storage  
1. **Day 1-2**: Add S3 utilities, keep local fallback
2. **Day 3-4**: Test both local and S3 uploads work
3. **Day 5**: Switch to S3 in production

### Week 3: Production Deployment
1. **Day 1-2**: Set up production environment
2. **Day 3-4**: Deploy and test
3. **Day 5**: Monitor and fix issues

## üö® What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

- ‚ùå Zero-downtime migrations
- ‚ùå Complex monitoring systems  
- ‚ùå Load balancing
- ‚ùå Advanced security features
- ‚ùå Performance optimization
- ‚ùå Comprehensive testing suites

**Why:** These are nice-to-haves that can be added later when you actually have users.

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] Users can register and login
- [ ] Existing classes/documents still work
- [ ] No data loss or breaking changes

### Phase 2 Success  
- [ ] Files upload to S3 in production
- [ ] Local development still works
- [ ] No file access issues

### Phase 3 Success
- [ ] App runs on cloud provider
- [ ] Users can access it from anywhere
- [ ] Basic monitoring shows it's working

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test each step** - Don't move to the next step until current one works
2. **Keep backups** - Export your database before schema changes
3. **Use feature flags** - Environment variables to enable/disable new features
4. **Start simple** - Add complexity only when needed
5. **Document changes** - Write down what you changed so you can rollback

---

## üîß Rollback Plan

### If User Accounts Break Something
```sql
-- Remove user_id from classes
ALTER TABLE classes DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS user_id;
-- Keep users table for later
```

### If S3 Breaks Something  
```bash
# Set environment variable to use local storage
export USE_S3=false
```

### If Production Deployment Fails
```bash
# Revert to local development
docker-compose up
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Add users table and auth service
2. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure existing functionality works
3. **Deploy incrementally** - One small change at a time
4. **Get feedback** - Have someone actually use it
5. **Iterate** - Fix issues as they come up

This approach is much more realistic and won't break your working MVP. Each step is small, testable, and can be rolled back if needed.
